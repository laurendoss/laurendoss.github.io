       <h3>Projects</h3>
      </p>
    
      <h4>Explore Cascadia</h4>
      <p>
          
        The objective of this project was to create a responsive webpage utilizing data from API's that we had not previously used in class. We chose to use the NPS (National Park Service) API and the Weather API. 
        Using the data collected from the response, we chose to display to the user the park hours, directions, five day forecast, and two images of each of the parks upon selection from the dropdown.

        This project required extensive work with multiple web API's, jQuery, JavaScript, and utilizing the Chrome Developer tools for styling and debugging. This project also required learning a new framework, Semantic UI.
        Explore Cascadia gave me a lot of experience collaborating on a team with other developers. My primary role was the 
        front end of the application, however, I also assisted with the back end API calls. 
        The project can be viewed either on my Portfolio page or <a href="https://dylanhulbert.github.io/project-01/">here</a>.
      </p>
      <h4>Explore Cocktails</h4>
      <p>
       The objective of this project was to create a responsive and deployed full-stack application which allows the user to 
       access and add to a database through various front end pages. We chose to create a Cocktail application where the user could
       look up cocktails based off either a type of liquor or specific cocktail name. The user is also able to add their own cocktails to the database,
       and view recently added cocktails. This project required the use of a lot of new technologies, including Node.js, MySQL, 
       Sequelize, Express, Heroku, and JawsDB. 
       My primary role on this project was to develop the backend of the application. I really enjoyed being able 
       to build out the server side portion of the app and I feel as though it really gave me a lot of backend experience that 
       I didn't previous have with Explore Cascadia. 
        The application can be viewed either on my Portfolio page or <a href="https://team-project-02.herokuapp.com/">here</a>.
